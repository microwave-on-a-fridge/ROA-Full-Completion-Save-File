So, you want to have (almost) everything unlocked in Rivals of Aether without having to do all the work? Then check this out:

I programmed a little script that automatically installs a 100% save file, and backs up your original save.

INSTRUCTIONS: Open "install.bat", and enjoy! (This won't unlock things you need to play online for, because I'm not sure how to do that yet)

I would also recommend using the "Free Milestones Buddy" to unlock other things like stages and such. Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2249926240

(Also, if you're running Rivals on Linux through WINE, I highly doubt that this will work, so if it doesn't, I'm sorry.)
